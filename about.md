##About

I’m an undergrad computer science student at the University of Toronto. I am currently in my third year and hope to secure a PEY job after I complete my third year.

I live in Scarborough, ON. In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, and watching TV shows. I occasionally read, but it’s hard for me to start reading a book. Once I find one I like, I can’t put it down. One of my favourite books is A Thousand Splendid Suns by Khaled Hosseini. Short stories are something I really enjoy. I typically like science fiction and fantasy. The best short story I ever read would probably be Flowers For Algernon.

I like working out, but find it very hard to stick to a schedule. I’m always one long class assignment away from ruining my current routine and more importantly my sleep habits.

Unfortunately, class takes up most of my time. Fortunately, the classes I’m taking this semester are very interesting.
